# VULTURE FOR NETHACK

This repository is for those who wants to build this game on windows from source. What do you need:

  - Vulture for NetHack source code - http://www.darkarts.co.za/vulture-for-nethack
  - MSYS2 environment - http://msys2.github.io/ (tested with x86_64-20160921)
  - Default path for MSYS2 is c:\msys64 - be careful if your path differs...
    - ...some variables in this project are hardcoded to the default MSYS2 path.
  - MSYS2 packages (pacman -S ...):
    - mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
    - mingw-w64-x86_64-libpng
    - mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL_ttf

    - mingw-w64-x86_64-libtheo
    - mingw-w64-x86_64-smpeg

After meeting the requirements run `vulture-build-env.bat` and execute `mingw32-make -f Makefile.gcc install`

Have fun!
